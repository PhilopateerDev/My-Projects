### 🛡️ AI Financial Fraud Detector (Simple Learning Project)
* **Goal:** A basic practice project to try and distinguish between normal and suspicious bank transactions.
* **How it works:** I used a simple **Random Forest** model to flag transactions based on basic rules (like the amount and the time of the transaction).
* **What I learned:** I built this to understand the basics of data classification and how to visualize results using a simple Confusion Matrix.
* **Status:** This is an initial educational implementation to explore AI security basics.
* **Code Location:** `AI-Financial-Fraud-Detector/main.py`
